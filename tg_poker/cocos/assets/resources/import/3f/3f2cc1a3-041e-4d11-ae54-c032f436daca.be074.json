Players use their hole cards alongside the board to make the best possible five-card hand according to the hand rankings. The best five-card poker hand wins the pot. \r\nThe difference from traditional Texas Hold'em is that there are no 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s in 6+ NLH. The smallest straight is A6789, and the flush is greater than the full house. \r\n\r\n&How to Play:\r\n1. When the game starts, one player will be chosen to be the Dealer (BTN) by random selection.\r\n2. First betting round begins after each player is dealt two hole cards face down, a.k.a.
